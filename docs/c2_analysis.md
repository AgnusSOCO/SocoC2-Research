# SharpC2 Analysis Document

## 1. Current C2 Architecture and Components

### Core Components
1. **Team Server (ASP.NET Core)**
   - Central command and control server
   - Handles authentication and session management using JWT
   - Implements handlers for different communication protocols
   - Manages drone registration and task delegation
   - Uses SignalR for real-time client notifications

2. **Drone (Implant)**
   - .NET Framework-based implant
   - Modular communication system with support for:
     - HTTP/HTTPS (primary)
     - SMB
     - TCP
     - External C2
   - Implements command execution and task handling
   - Supports peer-to-peer (P2P) communication
   - Features built-in port forwarding and SOCKS proxy capabilities

3. **Client (MAUI)**
   - Cross-platform GUI client
   - REST API communication with Team Server
   - Command management through YAML definitions
   - Real-time updates via SignalR

### Communication Protocols

1. **HTTP/HTTPS Handler**
   - Primary communication protocol
   - Supports customizable sleep and jitter
   - Configurable GET/POST paths for C2 traffic
   - SSL/TLS encryption with certificate validation

2. **SMB Handler**
   - Named pipe communication
   - Internal network operations
   - Useful for evading network detection

3. **TCP Handler**
   - Direct socket communication
   - Supports both bind and reverse connections
   - Binary protocol with length-prefixed messages

4. **External C2**
   - Custom protocol implementation
   - Allows third-party transport mechanisms
   - Standardized frame format for integration

### Command Structure and Execution Flow

1. **Command Processing**
   - Commands defined in YAML format
   - Loaded dynamically at runtime
   - Support for threaded and non-threaded execution
   - Task status tracking and output collection

2. **C2 Frame Format**
   - ProtoBuf serialization for efficiency
   - Structured message types:
     - CHECK_IN
     - TASK
     - TASK_OUTPUT
     - TASK_CANCEL
     - REV_PORT_FWD
     - SOCKS_PROXY
     - LINK
     - UNLINK
     - EXIT

3. **Task Execution**
   - Unique task IDs for tracking
   - Support for task cancellation
   - Asynchronous execution model
   - Error handling and status reporting

### Detection Vectors and Signatures

1. **Network Indicators**
   - Default HTTPS port 50050
   - JWT authentication headers
   - Customizable HTTP paths
   - Configurable sleep/jitter patterns

2. **Host Indicators**
   - .NET Framework dependency
   - Named pipe creation for SMB
   - TCP socket listeners
   - Process injection capabilities

3. **Potential Detection Methods**
   - SSL/TLS certificate monitoring
   - Named pipe enumeration
   - Network connection tracking
   - Process creation monitoring
   - Memory injection detection

4. **OPSEC Considerations**
   - Self-signed certificate usage
   - In-memory .NET assembly loading
   - Process token manipulation
   - Named pipe patterns
   - Network traffic patterns

## Modification Areas for Enhanced Stealth

1. **Communication Protocol Enhancements**
   - Implement domain fronting support
   - Add protocol proxy capabilities
   - Implement custom protocol obfuscation
   - Add traffic chunking and timing variations

2. **Payload Modifications**
   - Implement shellcode runner variants
   - Add process hollowing techniques
   - Implement indirect syscalls
   - Add AMSI/ETW bypass capabilities

3. **Infrastructure Improvements**
   - Implement redirector support
   - Add dynamic C2 profile generation
   - Implement domain rotation
   - Add malleable C2 profile support

4. **Evasion Enhancements**
   - Add memory obfuscation techniques
   - Implement sleep mask capabilities
   - Add sandbox detection
   - Implement EDR bypass techniques
